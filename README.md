# Coconut-Disease-Prediction
Coconut disease prediction using CNN model
Coconut disease prediction using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model involves leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify and predict diseases affecting coconut trees based on images.
Dataset Collection: A dataset containing images of healthy coconut trees and various diseased conditions is collected. This dataset should cover a range of coconut diseases to train the CNN model effectively.

## Data Preprocessing:
The collected dataset is preprocessed by resizing the images to a consistent size, normalizing the pixel values, and splitting it into training and testing sets. Preprocessing also involves labeling each image with the corresponding disease class.

## Model Architecture: 
A CNN model is designed for the task of disease prediction. CNNs are widely used for image-related tasks due to their ability to automatically learn relevant features from images. The model typically consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## Training:
The CNN model is trained using the training dataset. During training, the model learns to extract meaningful patterns and features from the input images, enabling it to differentiate between healthy and diseased coconut trees. The training process involves forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

## Evaluation:
The trained model is evaluated using the testing dataset to assess its performance and generalization capabilities. Accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics are used to evaluate how well the model predicts the presence of coconut diseases.

## Prediction: 
Once the CNN model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict diseases in new coconut tree images. The model takes an unseen image as input, applies its learned features and patterns, and predicts the probability or class of the disease affecting the coconut tree.

By using a CNN model for coconut disease prediction, it is possible to automate the identification and diagnosis process, enabling early detection and timely intervention to prevent or mitigate the impact of diseases on coconut trees.
